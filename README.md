# Microsoft_PowerBI_DataAnalyst_Certificate

> To be qualified this certification, I took the Exam DA-100: Analyzing Data with Microsoft Power BI on March 18, 2021. The Exam DA-100 was retired on March 31, 2022 and replaced by the PL-300: Power BI Data Analyst exam. PL-300 is essentially the same exam as DA-100 and covers the same core topics and skill areas:

- Prepare the data (15-20%)

- Model the data (30-35%)

- Visualize & Analyze the data (25-30%)

- Deploy & Maintain assets (20-25%)

> This PL-300 certification must be required annually in order to remain active. And I am happy to sucessfully renew my PL-300 certification on Janurary 6th 2023. From my perspective, this process of annual renewal is vital because Microsoft Power BI team has constantly been working on releasing new features and functionalies.
